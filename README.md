## About the Stitch API

The Nexmo Stitch API enables you to build conversation features where communication can take place across multiple platforms. The context of the conversations is maintained though each communication event taking place within a conversation, no matter the medium. Currently the Stitch SDKs support In-App Messaging and In-App Voice for iOS, Android and JavaScript. The JavaScript SDK also supports In-App Video.


## Participating in the Early Adopter program

The preview has evolved from In-App Messaging to also support In-App Voice and In-App Video. During this extended Beta program there will be frequent releases with new features and bug fixes based on your feedback. Changes will be communicated with each release outlying what changed. During the Beta it is possible (and probable) that there shall be breaking changes to the SDK and API but these will be explicitly communicated beforehand.
